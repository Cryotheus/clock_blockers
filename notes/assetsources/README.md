# Asset Sources
Cryotheum here, I've gone ahead and created an `assetsources` folder to provide the sources of any assets I might make. I've done this to make modification of existing assets easier.  
Below is a table you can use to find the software I am using for any file in this folder.

| Extension | What | Software                            |
