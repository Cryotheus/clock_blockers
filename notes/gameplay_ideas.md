# Gameplay Ideas

- Doors, etc that you have to hold open with a button. You need one of your remnants to hold it open to go through.
- Ways in which you can rely on enemy remnants to make forcing an unlink a hard decision.
- Limit the amount of ammo you get per-round; there's no way to pick up more.
