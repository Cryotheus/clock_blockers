# The Tree of Timelines

*A theoretical analysis of unlinking events in Clock Blockers*

---

On the surface, *Clock Blockers* appears quite straightforward: every round, *remnants* of your previous rounds re-enact your actions from the previous rounds. If a remnant is interfered with, it gets *unlinked* and becomes a *free agent* (controlled by AI or another player). However, when unlinking starts to stack between rounds, this gets *very* complicated quite fast.

This document will walk through a hypothetical game involving a few unlinking events to illustrate how a single interrupted path can quickly sprawl out into a web of branching timelines.

## Round 1

Say we have a hypothetical map containing an elevator. This elevator has two floors, and it can be sent to either floor from buttons next to the doors on each floor, as well as inside the elevator.

This elevator begins on the bottom floor. About halfway through Round 1, a player gets in the elevator and takes it to the top floor. Then they get out and go about their business.

## Round 2

In Round 2, the player wants to take the elevator again, but they get there before their Round 1 remnant (Remnant 1). They take it to the top and get out.

As a consequence, when Remnant 1 arrives at the elevator, it cannot get on because the elevator is now at the top. Therefore, Remnant 1 gets unlinked, becomes a free agent and forges a new path.

## Round 3

Here's where things begin to get complicated.

At the beginning of Round 3, the player realizes that taking the elevator in Round 2 was a mistake, as they were relying on something they did *after* taking the elevator in Round 1 (which no-longer happens due to the unlink.)

To fix this, they get in the elevator with Remnant 2 and send it back to the bottom once they reach the top. Now, when Remnant 1 arrives at the elevator, it is able to get on. Although it had been unlinked in Round 2, since the elevator is here, it continues on its original path from Round 1. However, this path is not locked in stone.

## Round 4

Round 4 starts out like all the other rounds; Remnants 2 and 3 make their way towards the elevator, ready to take it up and then send it back down for Remnant 1. However, before it can reach the elevator, Remnant 3 gets killed by a free agent. Now, when Remnant 2 takes the elevator to the top, it is *not* sent back down. Therefore, when Remnant 1 arrives, it can't get on and it gets unlinked. 

However, this is not a *true* unlink. Because this unlinking event has already happened in a previous timeline (Round 2), it is considered a part of Remnant 1's canon. Instead of becoming a free agent, Remnant 1 continues on its path from Round 2 when it got unlinked the first time. (Of course, it could always be unlinked again, at which point it *would* become a free agent.)

At this point in the game, Remnant 1 has a fork in its timeline: two branching paths that it will take depending on the state of the elevator. Each path, the original path and the Round 2 path, are equally as valid, and have the potential to be considered canon in any other remnant's timeline.

## Round 5

Because each remnant has its own, independent canon, the way the timelines interact with each other can become quite messy:

In Round 5, the active player moves to save Remnant 3 in an attempt to restore Remnant 1's original timeline. However, in doing so, Remnant 2 gets killed. Now, when Remnant 3 gets to the elevator, Remnant 2 isn't there to press the button, so Remnant 3 gets unlinked, becoming a free agent. The timeline has now branched.

Yet, when Remnant 1 arrives at the elevator, it still gets in and enacts its Round 1 timeline. While its true Remnant 3 wasn't able to send the elevator back down to Remnant 1, the elevator was never sent up in the first place, so Remnant 1 can still use it.

Even though the circumstances leading to the unlink event have been tampered with, Remnant 1's timeline remains intact. If another free agent takes the elevator before Remnant 1 can get to it, Remnant 1 will continue on its Round 2 path even though the elevator is missing for a different reason.

It's even possible that Remnant 1 causes the unlink of another remnant during its Round 2 timeline. In this case, the elevator would also determine which branch that other remnant takes, albeit indirectly.

## Conclusion

It can help to think of these timelines as a set of neighboring trees. While their branches are all inter-tangled, each has a discrete trunk at its base. When a new tree grows in, some of the existing branches are interfered with, yet others remain untouched.

Depending on the circumstances, even one small change by a free agent can impact the entire round. Yet, these changes are predictable, and calculable by evaluating the timeline tree. This is what makes *Clock Blockers* such an interesting strategy game; being able to understand this tree and reason your way through it will permit you to make big-brain plays that win you the game.
